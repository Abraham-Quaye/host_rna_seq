   abstract = {Adenoviruses (family Adenoviridae) are nonenveloped, icosahedral particles with linear, double-stranded DNA genomes of 26–45kbp containing inverted terminal repeats of 36–368bp. Adeoviruses have been isolated from every major vertebrate class from fish to mammals. Members of genus Mastadenovirus occur in mammals and those of genus Aviadenovirus are found in birds. Reptilian adenoviruses belong to genus Atadenovirus, but other at adenoviruses occur also in ruminants, birds, and a marsupial (possibly as a result of host class switches) and have a high A+T content in these hosts. Genus Siadenovirus contains adenoviruses from birds and a frog, and is named after a putative sialidase gene that is absent from other genera. The single confirmed fish adenovirus falls into a potential fifth genus. Adenoviruses are grouped further into species based mainly on phylogenetic measures. Human (together with chimpanzee) adenoviruses are classified into six species: Human adenovirus A to Human adenovirus F. The structural and biological properties of the mastadenoviruses have been studied in detail, and the characterization of bird and lower vertebrate adenoviruses has just begun. The middle portion of all adenovirus genomes is well conserved, whereas the regions toward the ends are characteristic of genera and sometimes even species. Adenoviruses are popular candidates for vector development with a view to applications in gene therapy, immunization, and antitumor medicine.},

   title = {Characterization of Avirulent Turkey Hemorrhagic Enteritis Virus: A Study of the Molecular Basis for Variation in Virulence and the Occurrence of Persistent Infection},
   university = {Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University},
   type = {Dissertation},
   abstract = {Hemorrhagic enteritis is a disease of turkeys caused by virulent strains of Turkey Hemorrhagic Enteritis Virus (THEV) resulting in depression, splenomegaly, intestinal hemorrhage, immunosuppression, and mortality. Avirulent strains that do not produce intestinal lesions and mortality are used in live-virus vaccines that protect turkeys from virulent field challenge. The cause for the difference in phenotype between virulent and avirulent strains is unknown. The full-length genome of the Virginia Avirulent Strain (VAS) of THEV was sequenced and compared to the genome sequence of a virulent field isolate from Israel. Genetic differences were found in seven viral genes. Further sequencing narrowed the focus from seven genes to three: ORF1, E3, and Fiber. Consistent variation in these genes between strains of THEV with different phenotypes strongly indicates these genes as key factors affecting virulence. THEV is an officially recognized member of the viral family Adenoviridae, genus Siadenovirus. The genomes of the members of the genus, THEV and Frog Adenovirus 1, are not well-characterized. The genome sequences of both members were compared for the prediction of genetic and structural elements. Common features were found that distinguish this genus from all other adenoviruses, and differences were found that possibly contribute to host specificity of the members. The VAS is known to stimulate a life-long protective antibody response, though viral replication is only of short duration. Several studies were undertaken to determine changes in virus location and serology over time. Viral DNA was detected in various tissues through 15 weeks post-infection in the presence of high antibody titers. THEV infection was found to be similar to the non-lytic persistent infections seen with human adenoviruses. Regardless of the mechanism involved in the persistent stimulation of antibodies in infected turkeys, the VAS was shown to be an ideal vector for use in a recombinant live-virus vaccine. The next step in THEV research should be the creation of a full-length infectious DNA clone, which could be used in the creation of a recombinant vaccine. The infectious clone would also allow for the systematic testing of genes that are suspected to be involved in virulence.},

   abstract = {Infection of turkeys with the haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV), a type II avian adenovirus, results in varying rates of morbidity and mortality. The disease is characterised by splenomegaly, intestinal haemorrhage, sudden death and immunosuppression. The mechanisms of HEV immunopathogenesis and immunosuppression are not fully understood. Recent studies indicate that immune responses play a central role in disease pathogenesis. HEV infects B cells and macrophages and induces necrosis as well as apoptosis in infected and possibly in by-stander cells. The ability of the infected birds to mount an optimum humoral immune response as well as normal macrophage functions such as phagocytosis may be impaired. Elevated numbers of splenic CD4(+) cells during the acute phase of infection may be associated with viral clearance. Types I and II interferons (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis-like factors (TNF) are released at the peak of the infection. Cytokines may play a protective as well as a destructive role. While a massive release of proinflammatory cytokines may lead to systemic shock associated with haemorrhagic enteritis and death, release of IFNs may protect turkeys from the disease. Treatment with thalidomide, which is a potent TNF down-regulatory drug, prevented HEV-induced intestinal haemorrhage and treatment with an IFN-inducing chemical prevented HEV-replication and inhibited HEV-induced pathological and histopathological lesions.},
